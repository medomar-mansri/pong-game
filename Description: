Ping Pong is a simple 2D arcade game where two players control paddles on opposite sides of the screen, attempting to hit a ball back and forth between them without missing. The objective of the game is to score points by making the ball pass the opponent's paddle. Each time a player misses hitting the ball, the opponent scores a point.
It's a classic game that requires quick reflexes and precise control to outmaneuver the opponent and emerge victorious.
